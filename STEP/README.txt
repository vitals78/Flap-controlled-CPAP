Filters purchased on Aliexpress have different lengths, so
the mount needs to be adjusted separately for the filter.
In addition, the outlet of the WS7040 fan is not perfectly
round, so the fitting in my case is made elliptical.
Therefore, the downloaded STEP will need to be seriously edited
to your fan opening dimensions, and the filter length. Also, STEP
file includes a new fan duct. You can check its detailed test here:
