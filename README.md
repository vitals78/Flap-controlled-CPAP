# Flap-controlled-CPAP
The design of the print cooling fan, controlled by a flap, allows more precise cooling of overhangs.
1. Controlling the airflow with a flap allows for more precise cooling of overhangs. This enables the printing of more durable parts, as there is no overcooling caused by the prestart of the blower fan. Overcooling is also eliminated due to the lack of impact from the rotor’s inertia.
2. The WS7040 fan begins rotating at 18-21% power, which may be excessive in some cases (for example, printing ABS, ASA). In contrast, flap-controlled airflow can start at just 1%.
3. The rotor’s inertia in the cooling fan has no significant impact, enabling the use of various fan types, including centrifugal blowers, Roborock vacuum cleaner fans, and powerful server fans.
